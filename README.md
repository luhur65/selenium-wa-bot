# Wa Bot
## A simple bot for WhatsApp

This is a simple bot for WhatsApp, it is written in Python and uses Selenium to control the browser.  
This bot is not intended to be used for spamming or other illegal activities, it is only intended to be used for educational purposes.The bot is currently in development, so it is not yet complete.  

I make this bot for fun and to learn more about Python and Selenium.  

Happy coding!, Cheers! :)
